Back in 2014, I was living in Santar√©m-Brazil, a small city in the less
technologicaly developed region of Brazil: The North. The tech scenario was
composed by 1 startup, a couple PHP developers, maybe 2 designers, six
universities and a lot of students with focus on academics.

At the time, I had my own _small_ company focused on delivering MVP software for baby
startups, with a team of 2 developers (including me), 1 designer and 1 product manager.
After a few months, we noticed that we needed to build a local community in
order to bring more people to our context and teach then about technologies that
were using on ours projects, like: Ruby On Rails, AngularJS, Laravel, Ansible and so on.

Not only teach then, but learn from then and provide an enviroment that would
facilitate networking, opportunities and new businesses. So, I founded
DevInSanta.

After that, I started and helped a few communities (FloripaOnRails,
GophersFloripa). So, in this article I'll share what I've been learning in this
endeavor so far.

## Don't give up too soon

## The community is not yours
