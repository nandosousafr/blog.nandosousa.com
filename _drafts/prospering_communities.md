I've started coding professionally in 2011, right after that was introduced to
Ruby World. Better than that, I was introduced to the Ruby community, maybe
the most revolutionary things that Ruby gave to us.

At that time was living at Santar√©m-Brazil, on it, I was the only Ruby Developer
at that moment. But I didn't felt alone at all, I felt part of something, part
of an ideology. An ideology to write better software.

So what we can learn from Ruby Community in terms of building and prospering
local communities?

## Open the door for newcomers

Became a RubyDeveloper is easy, there are a bunch of good content available for
free. Ask a RubyDeveloper the following questions:

* Do you know RubyTapas?
* Do you know tryruby.org?
* Did you make RailsForZombies (free course)?
* Did you have ever watched an episode of RailsCasts by @ryanbates?

I'm pretty sure that for almost everyone the answer of all these is __yes__.
In these days, all languages have a RailsCasts like and a tryruby.org like.
These initiatives brutally reduce newcomer's learning curve.

So, start doing the same thing whatever be the goal of your meetup, study
group or whatever. Create content that breaks the __initial barier__.

If you're leading a meetup and you're organizing a mini-conf, make sure you have
all level of contents, especially for novices.
