Yesterday (2017-11-09), I attended the [1st Elixir
Day](https://www.meetup.com/elixirsc/events/243952567) in
Florianopolis-Brazil. And, I had the opportunity to talk about metaprogramming
in [Elixir](http://tech.nandosousa.com/categories/elixir).

It was really nice to see other local developers interested in the language and
functional programming in general. In my opinion, be open to learning new languages is one of
the keys to a successful career in software development.
