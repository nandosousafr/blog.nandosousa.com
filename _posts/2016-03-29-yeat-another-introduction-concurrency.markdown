Concurrency is a hot topic nowadays. There are many people talking about, some
complaining about Ruby, some expressing some love for Closure, Go, Elixir,
Haskel, Scala etcâ€¦ The goal of this article is to deliver a simple and clear
introduction and answer why this is a topic that every developer should be
aware of.

## Why this is a hot topic?

Simple answer: __Multicore crisis__. In 1965, Gordon Moore (Co-founder of
Intel) quote the following:

> The number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit double approximately
> every two years. Wikipedia

This observation became known as the famous __Moore's Law__. But, recently we're
experiencing a __natural__ reducing of pace. We cannot make  things (in
this case transistors) smaller forever. Beside that fact, single super fast chips
increase problems with __heat__ and __energy consumption__.

Conclusion, the __Moore's Law__ continues to deliver, but instead as a _single
super chip_, we're seeing every day more cores integrating a single CPU.

## The free lunch is over!
